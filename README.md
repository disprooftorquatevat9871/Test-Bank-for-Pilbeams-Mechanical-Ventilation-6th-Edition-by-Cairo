  * Learn everything you need to safely and compassionately care for patients requiring ventilator support with Pilbeam's Mechanical Ventilation: Physiological and Clinical Applications, 6th Edition. Known for its simple explanations and in-depth coverage of patient-ventilator management, this evidence-based text walks readers through the most fundamental and advanced concepts surrounding mechanical ventilation and guides them in properly applying these principles to patient care. This new edition features a completely revised chapter on ventilator graphics, additional case studies and clinical scenarios, plus all the reader-friendly features that promote critical thinking and clinical application ― like key points, AARC clinical practice guidelines, and critical care concepts ― that have helped make this text a household name among respiratory care professionals.
